# EXPLORING-WEATHER-TRENDS

In this project, analysis of local and Global temerature data was carried out. I compared the temperature trends of where I live (Lagos, Nigeria) to the overall Global temperatures trends.

### Tools Used in this Project
- SQL
- Microsoft Excel
- Python in Jupyter notebook

These was my result from the Analysis:

#### From the line chart above, The following Observation was made;

- My City(Lagos Nigeria), temperature is hotter on average as compared to the Global average moving temperature.
- The difference between Lagos's temperature and that of the globe fluntuates between 17-18 degrees celsius.
- From around 1860 to 1878, the average temperatures were a bit constant for both Lagos and World. The temperature for both then increaed around 1885 and the dropped around 1890.
- From the year 1890 till date, The temperature kept getting hotter consistently for both Lagos and the globe at large.

#### From the scatter plot, it is seen that they have a strong positive correlation with correlation coefficient of 0.89

Note that due to the strong positive correletion between the average temperature in Lagos and the World, using a strong prediction linear model, the temperature of Lagos can be estimated when that of the world is given.
